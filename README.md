Number Guessing Game
What is this poject?
This is a simple Python game where you guess a number between 1 and 100. The computer picks a random number, and you have up to 5 guesses to find it. After each guess, it tells you if your guess is too high or too low. If you guess right, you win! If you run out of guesses, it shows the number.
Why I made it
I’m learning Python and Git, and this poject helps me practice:

Basic Python (loops, conditionals, random numbers).
Using Git and GitHub to save and share code.
Writing code that’s fun and easy to understand.

How to run it

Get the code:

Clone this resporatey:git clone https://github.com/LtAmritRaj2/number-guessing-game.git
cd number-guessing-game




Run the game:

Make sure you have Python 3 installed (python3 --version).
Run the script:python3 number_guessing_game.py


Follow the prompts to guess a number!


What to expect:

Enter a number between 1 and 100.
You’ll see hints like “Too low!” or “Too high!”.
Win by guessing the number in 10 tries or less, or see the answer if you lose.


How to continew (contribute)
Want to make the game better? Here’s how:

Fork this resporatey on GitHub.
Clone your fork:git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/number-guessing-game.git


Make changes (e.g., add a score system or new messages).
Commit and push:git add number_guessing_game.py
git commit -m "Add new feature"
git push origin main


Create a Pull Request on GitHub to share your changes.

Ideas for new features:

Change the number range (e.g., 1-50).
Add a score system.
Save high scores to a file.

What I learned

Python basics: loops, conditionals, user input.
Git commands: git add, git commit, git push.
GitHub: Creating resporateys and pushing code.
Writing a README to explain my poject.

About me
I’m Amrit, a beginner learning Python and Git. This is one of my first pojects to build skills and make my GitHub profile look cool!
Thanks
Thanks for checking out my game! Feel free to play and share ideas to make it better.
